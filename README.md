# Multiplayer Worms

Hello, and welcome to my browser-based multiplayer worms game. The front-end was built with Vue.js 3 and the back-end was made with Node.js/Socket.IO. The Render server does sleep after long periods of inactivity, so if the join/host buttons aren't responding just try waiting a minute for the server to wakeup. It's of course possible to play alone, but it's far more fun playing with friends.

Grow the largest out of all the other worms to win. Enjoy.
